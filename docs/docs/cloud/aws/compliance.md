## CLI Commands

Scan for misconfigurations in an AWS account based on AWS CIS 1.2 benchmark:

```shell
$ trivy aws --compliance=awscis1.2

arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/DummyRoleManager (cloud)

Tests: 1 (SUCCESSES: 0, FAILURES: 1, EXCEPTIONS: 0)

LOW: One or more policies are attached directly to a user
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CIS recommends that you apply IAM policies directly to groups and roles but not users. Assigning privileges at the group or role level reduces the complexity of access management as the number of users grow. Reducing access management complexity might in turn reduce opportunity for a principal to inadvertently receive or retain excessive privileges.

See https://avd.aquasec.com/misconfig/avd-aws-0143

Furthermore, you can also get the report in a JSON format.
```shell
$ trivy aws --compliance=awscis1.2 --report=summary --format=json
```

```json
{
	"ID": "0001",
	"Title": "awscis1.2",
	"SummaryControls": [{
			"ID": "1.1",
			"Name": "limit-root-account-usage",
			"Severity": "LOW",
			"TotalFail": 5
		},
		{
			"ID": "1.10",
			"Name": "no-password-reuse",
			"Severity": "MEDIUM",
			"TotalFail": 1
		}
	]
}
```


## Custom compliance report

The Trivy AWS CLI allows you to create a custom compliance specification and pass it to trivy for generating scan report.

The report is generated based on scanning result mapping between users define controls and trivy checks ID.
The supported checks are from two types and can be found at [Aqua vulnerability DB](https://avd.aquasec.com/):
- [misconfiguration](https://avd.aquasec.com/misconfig/)

### Compliance spec format
The compliance spec file format should be as follows:


```yaml
---
spec:
  id: "0001"
  title: awscis1.2
  description: AWS CIS Foundations
  version: "1.2"
  relatedResources:
  - https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services
  controls:
  - id: "1.1"
    name: limit-root-account-usage
    description: |-
      The "root" account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. It is highly
      recommended that the use of this account be avoided.
    checks:
    - id: AVD-AWS-0140
    severity: LOW
```

## Custom report CLI Commands

To use a custom spec, the file path should be passed to the `--compliance` flag with `@` prefix as follows:

```
$ trivy aws --compliance=@/spec/my_compliance.yaml
```
